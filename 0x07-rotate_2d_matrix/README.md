## Rotate 2D Matrix

### Concepts Needed:

##### Matrix Representation in Python:
* Understanding how 2D matrices are represented using lists of lists in Python.

* Accessing and modifying elements in a 2D matrix.

##### In-place Operations:
* Performing operations on data without creating a copy of the data structure.

* The importance of minimizing space complexity by modifying the matrix in place.

##### Matrix Transposition:
* Understanding the concept of transposing a matrix (swapping rows and columns).

* Implementing matrix transposition as a step in the rotation process.

##### Reversing Rows in a Matrix:
* Manipulating rows of a matrix by reversing their order as part of the rotation process.

##### Nested Loops:
* Using nested loops to iterate through 2D data structures like matrices.

* Modifying elements within nested loops to achieve the desired rotation.
