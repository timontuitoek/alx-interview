### Island Perimeter

#### Concepts Needed:

###### 2D Arrays (Matrices):
* Accessing and iterating over elements in a 2D array.
* Understanding how to navigate through adjacent cells (horizontally and vertically).

###### Conditional Logic:
* Applying conditions to determine whether a cell contributes to the perimeter of the island.

###### Counting Techniques:
* Developing a method to count the edges that contribute to the islandâ€™s perimeter.

###### Problem-Solving Strategies:
* Breaking down the problem into smaller tasks, such as identifying land cells and calculating their contribution to the perimeter.

###### Python Programming:
* Nested loops for iterating over grid cells.
* Conditional statements to check the status of adjacent cells
