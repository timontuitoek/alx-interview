<h1>Pascal's Triangle</h1>
<p>A pascal's triangle is an arrangement of numbers in a triangular array such that the numbers at the end of each row are 1 and the remaining numbers are the sum of the nearest two numbers in the above row.<p>
<h3>What Are the Types of Algorithms in Python?<p>
<p>Tree traversal algorithms are designed to visit all nodes of a tree graph, starting from the root and traversing each node according to the instructions laid out. Traversal can occur in order, with the algorithm traversing the tree from node to edge (branches), or from the edges to the root.<p><br>
<p>Sorting algorithms provide various ways of arranging data in a particular format, with common algorithms including bubble sort, merge sort, insertion sort and shell sort.<p><br>
<p>Searching algorithms check and retrieve elements from different data structures, with variations including linear search and binary search.<p><br>
<p>Graph algorithms traverse graphs from their edges in a depth-first (DFS) or breadth-first (BFS) manner.<p><br>
