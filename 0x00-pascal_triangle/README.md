    <h1>Pascal's Triangle</h1>
    
    <p>
        Pascal's Triangle is a mathematical concept named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal. It is a triangular array of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The triangle starts with the number 1 at the top, and each subsequent row is constructed by adding the adjacent numbers in the row above.

        This triangular pattern has various applications in combinatorics, probability theory, and algebra. It reveals interesting number patterns and coefficients, making it a valuable tool in different branches of mathematics.
    </p>

    <p>
        In Pascal's Triangle, the binomial coefficients are represented, and it has connections to the coefficients in the expansion of binomial expressions. The symmetry and patterns within the triangle have fascinated mathematicians for centuries.

        To explore Pascal's Triangle further, one can create it programmatically using a programming language like Python or explore its properties for a deeper understanding of its mathematical significance.
