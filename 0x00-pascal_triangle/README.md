Pascal's Triangle is a mathematical construct named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal. It is a triangular array of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

###
The triangle starts with the number 1 at the top, and each subsequent row is generated by adding the adjacent numbers in the row above. This triangular pattern holds significance in combinatorics, probability theory, and algebra.

It unveils intriguing number patterns and coefficients, making it a valuable tool in various mathematical disciplines. Pascal's Triangle is renowned for its connections to binomial coefficients and the expansion of binomial expressions. The symmetrical and structured nature of the triangle has captivated mathematicians for centuries, offering a rich field for exploration and mathematical insights.
