## Making Change

* For the “0. Change comes from within” project, you will tackle a classic problem from the domain of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms: the coin change problem. The objective is to find the minimum number of coins required to make up a given total amount, given a list of coin denominations. This project challenges you to apply your understanding of algorithms to devise a solution that is not only correct but also efficient. Below are the key concepts and resources necessary to complete this project successfully.

### Concepts Needed:


##### Greedy Algorithms:
* Understanding how greedy algorithms work and why they are suitable for the coin change problem

* Recognizing the limitations of greedy algorithms and scenarios where they might not provide the optimal solution.

##### Dynamic Programming:
* Basic principles of dynamic programming as a method to solve optimization problems.

* The concept of overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure in the context of the coin change problem.

##### Algorithmic Complexity:
* Analyzing the time and space complexity of algorithms

* Striving for solutions with lower complexity to meet runtime constraints

##### Problem-Solving Strategies:
* Breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable sub-problems

* Iterative vs recursive approaches to dynamic programming.

##### Python Programming:
* Manipulating lists and using list comprehensions.

* Implementing functions with efficient looping and conditional statements.
